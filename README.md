# HTML

## Problems to change

- The stucture of the the page is not written in a semantic way, there are too may div tags are being used. 
- The image elements need descriptive alt attributes added for easier understanding and accessibility. 
- Also the title needs to be more concise and descriptive.
- One of the navigation links is not in the tag so that needs to be fixed.

### Solutions

- Changed the div tags to semantic tags so the structure is more easily understood. 
- Added descriptive alt attributes to the image elements for easier understanding and accessibility to the page.
- Gave the title a more concise descriptive name.
- Added an ID attribute the the correct element tag to fix the broken page navigation issue


# CSS

## Problems to change

- There are too many class selectors repeated for the same properties. For example the .benefit-lead, .benefit-cost, .benefit-brand all have the same margins and colour.
- The type of selectors can be changed to regular elements instead of class selectors where nessecery.

# Solutions

- These class selectors (example - .benefit-lead, .benefit-cost, .benefit-brand) can all be grouped into one instead of three separate ones so theres less unessarcery information on the page.
- Removed the class selector elements and just used element selectors instead.
